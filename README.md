# PlaneConstraintNE

###### 1. Requirements
Install Pytorch
The code was tested with Python3.6 torch1.4.0 pytorch 1.7.1 cuda10.2

###### 2.Data
The code was trained by PCPNet Dataset
 
###### 3. Train
To train a model run "train_pcpnet_multi.py" and you also can use  a trained model named "mask_res_models_0.5_0.5__multi2" to test.

you can obtain the trained model and the results via BaiduYun link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1atfx5lJ5-cGquzE83ltxqw  code: 5cdu

The code is built on the top of PCPNet. Thanks for the precedent contribution.
